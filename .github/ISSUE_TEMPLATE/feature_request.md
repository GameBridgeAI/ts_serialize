> A one-paragraph explanation of the change.

**Motivation**

> Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

**Design Detail**

> This is the bulk of the RFC.

> Explain the design in enough detail for somebody familiar with the infrastructure to understand. This should get into specifics and corner-cases, and include examples of how the service is used. Any new terminology should be defined here.

**Drawbacks**

> Why should we _not_ do this? Please consider the impact on users, on the integration of this change with other existing and planned features etc.

> There are tradeoffs to choosing any path, please attempt to identify them here.

**Unresolved questions**

> What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the RFC process?

> What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation of this feature before stabilization?

> What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFC that could be addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this RFC?
